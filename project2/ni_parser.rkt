QUESTIONS!!

(parse-str "-5+(ni a is 6)*5*a") this doesn't cause an error. But not sure if should be able to do anything like this.

Function declarations, currently inside of function, only has 1 expression, but how separate is more than one expression.
(a is b) + c is in the documentation of something that is syntatcially correct, but I don't see the use of IS by itself. Shouldn't it have a NOW or something??
